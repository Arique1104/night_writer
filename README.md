## Being anti-racist programmers is step 1 to being an empathetic and ethical programmer.  
- Transition your branch name "master" to "main"
- The historical context of a master in the US has roots in slavery.  Effectively evoking imagery and ancestoral trauma and doing so casually.  It is no longer acceptable.  
- But it is also not about symbolic changes.  This is an invitation to have a discussion about whether or not we want to exist in a culture that is casual about racism or actively anti-racism.  Let's do this.  Here are the directions:

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use mkdir to create a new directory if you have not already.
- cd into that directory.
- Run git init to make that directory a Git repository.
- The default branch created with git is named master. Rename this to main by running: git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main

No more excuses.  Let's end racism, let's demand reparation for our black brothers, sisters, and siblings, and let's pick up our role as anti-racists...one conversation and relationship at a time.
